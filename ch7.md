# Core System: Wire Transfer

* Type: Push Model

* Regulation: Federal Reserve Bank Regulations, Private Network Rules
* Payment Network Economy: Par Value Clearing
* Processing Flow: Electronic, Real-time
* Risk Management: Network, Processing Merchants, and End Users

Wire transfer systems play a significant role in the payment systems in the United States. The U.S. wire transfer system and its corresponding systems worldwide are also known as "large-value transfer systems," designed to handle very high-value transactions between businesses, especially financial institutions.

Unlike most industrialized countries, the United States has two such systems: Fedwire and CHIPS. The important third system, SWIFT, is not a payment system but a global financial services messaging system, often used in conjunction with large-value systems.

### Herstatt Risk Inheritance

In 1974, the collapse of Germany's Herstatt Bank in a single day caused massive losses globally and led to a series of bank failures. This risk, known as "Herstatt risk," prompted the development of global RTGS and CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement) systems.

Over the past 20 years, most large-value systems worldwide have been modified to become Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems. These systems do not use the "net settlement" process typical of paper and electronic consumer systems but settle each transaction in real-time. This gross settlement is essential to avoid risks associated with potential bank failures. With billions, sometimes even trillions, of dollars transferred daily, even if only one member bank fails in a day, a net settlement system would expose the network (including network owners) to unbearable risks.
