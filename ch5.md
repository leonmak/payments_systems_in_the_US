Bank card payment systems captivate many in the financial services and many other industries as they are at the heart of consumer commerce, facilitating consumer and business spending worth trillions of dollars annually. Due to its vast scale, extensive global coverage, remarkable standardization, and interoperability, the card system is particularly crucial (enabling a cardholder from Topeka, Kansas to walk into a bar in Singapore and purchase a drink), perhaps most importantly, the astounding profits flowing to credit card issuers in recent years have also flowed to other participants in the payment card value chain.

## Historical Background

The payment card industry originated in the early 20th century with the "charge cards" of private department stores and oil companies. Later, the charge cards issued by Diners Club and American Express in the 1950s were primarily used for travel and entertainment (T&E), establishing early "closed-loop" card systems.

However, what we know today as the bank card industry began in 1966 when Bank of America established BankAmerica Service Corporation to license its BankAmericard product to other banks. Bank of America introduced BankAmericard in the late 1950s and planned to expand it throughout California. By the mid-1960s, it began licensing BankAmericard to other banks outside California and in some other countries. By 1970, affiliates sought a new organizational structure for the product, leading to the formation of National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI) to manage the U.S. credit card program. In the mid-1970s, a similar organization was established to manage the international card program. Shortly thereafter, these two organizations formed a new company called Visa, with the international organization (IBANCO) becoming Visa International and NBI becoming Visa USA, a member of Visa International's group.

Additionally, in competition with the Bank of America card program, another group of California banks formed a competing organization called the Interbank Card Association (ICA). The ICA created Master Charge: Interbank Card and in 1979 renamed itself and its product to Mastercard.

The early work done by these newly formed member-based financial institution associations was remarkable. They established principles of open financial institution membership, allowing for open exchange of transactions, fees, and brand control through association bylaws and operating rules. Over time, these rules continued to evolve, defining the card payment system.

It is worth noting that these rules laid the foundation for interoperability, which rapidly developed globally as credit card systems in other countries/regions evolved, connecting with the Visa and Mastercard systems to expand their coverage. Interoperability is primarily technical, establishing agreements and timelines for issuance, acceptance, and transaction management aspects, but the card associations also defined the system's economics, brand management, and transaction fee requirements.

Over time, the card associations played a significant role in managing card fraud - requiring issuers to report confirmed fraud to the association and using confirmed fraud "outcome data" to build increasingly sophisticated data analysis systems to help combat it.

The associations also established arbitration procedures to resolve disputes among members, ensuring that any such disputes would be resolved "in-house" and overseen by association staff acting as courts, judges, and juries.
