# Perspective: System Users

This chapter begins the two chapters on stakeholders involved in the payment system. First, we will explore the perspective of users - what is most important for both senders and receivers of funds flowing through any payment system. Here, we will examine traditional consumer and merchant stakeholders, as well as businesses including merchants, billers, governments, and non-profit organizations.

In the next chapter, we will continue to study from the perspective of providers of various payment systems, including banks, networks and clearinghouses, processors, and payment service providers that play such a crucial role in enabling and operating payment systems.

## Consumer Perspective

The United States currently has a population of over 321 million residents, ranking as the third most populous country in the world, but accounting for only 4.5% of the world's total population. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, the U.S. population will reach 439 million. China (19.7%) and India (17.2%) are several times larger than the U.S., with Indonesia ranking fourth (3.4%), just behind the U.S.

The U.S. is comprised of over 115 million households, of which around 87 million have traditional bank accounts. Approximately 10 million households, or 17 million adults, make up a group commonly referred to as "unbanked." The FDIC states that an additional 20 million households (45 million adults) are "underbanked."

By the FDIC's definition, "unbanked" refers to individuals who have little to no access to checking, savings, or "other types of transaction or check-cashing accounts" at insured depository institutions in the traditional financial system. On the other hand, the "underbanked" have bank or credit union accounts but also rely on other payment and financial services, including check-cashing services, payday loans, and money orders.

From the perspective of the payment system, the banking industry focuses on consumers through the lens of "households," with basic deposit accounts typically jointly owned by household heads.
