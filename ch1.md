# Introduction

Payments are a big part of our lives. We pay for things we want and need. We fumble through our wallets or pockets for change, we rummage through our cards in our wallets just to find the right one to make a purchase. We write checks or pay bills online. We buy gift cards and plan to pay off mortgages. We shop online or on our phones, using a variety of cards and wallets for payment. We send money to family and friends. We worry about where to get the funds for large payments, trying to find the right payment method. Everyone's needs are different. For some, convenience is most important, for others, control, rewards, or following the way their parents taught them, deciding how and why we make payments.

As business people, we also make business payments: to employees, to suppliers, to the government. We also receive payments for business activities: from consumers or from trade.

These activities are at the center of our personal and business lives. For some, they also provide the fuel for our livelihoods. Beneath these simple payment transactions is the entire payment industry's system, products, companies.

This book is written for payment experts. Payment experts work for companies that provide payment transactions. This certainly includes banks, but also other types of companies: processors, payment services, software companies, POS manufacturers, service providers, risk controllers, etc. Some companies dominate, others are competitors: startups that introduce innovation to the industry. Most will fail or stagnate, but a few will succeed, become dominators, and await the next round of challengers. Other payment experts are responsible for sending and receiving funds within companies. Some become consultants, advisors, lawyers, industry investors.

Like many industries, experts struggle to keep up with changes in the overall environment, technology, consumer and merchant payment habits. Some experts specialize in a payment system (cards, or ACH), while others focus on a specific function such as the consumer market or risk management. This book provides a comprehensive view of the entire U.S. payment industry, including all payment systems and functions.

This book is not a source of statistical data for the payment industry. There are many industry data sources available: at the end of each chapter, we will provide some references that can provide more information on a specific payment system or topic.

We will strive to be impartial, and opinions, speculations, rumors are set in shaded boxes. We welcome your questions and comments. Email us at books@glenbrook.com, and we will respond!
