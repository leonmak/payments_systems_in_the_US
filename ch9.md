# Perspective: System Providers

This chapter summarizes the two chapters on stakeholders in the payment system. In the previous chapter, we discussed the users of the payment system, especially the senders and receivers of funds in the payment system.

In this chapter, we focus on the service providers in the payment system: banks, networks, clearinghouses, and processors (they play key roles behind the scenes in the payment system).

Historically, banks have owned and controlled the major payment systems in the United States. Consumers and businesses use the payment system through their roles as bank customers. Banks are also the primary direct economic beneficiaries of the payment system.

However, the position of banks in this field has been changing, with some payment systems no longer owned by banks, and non-bank participants playing significant roles.
