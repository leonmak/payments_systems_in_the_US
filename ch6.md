# Core System: Cash

* Type: Push Model
* Ownership: None
* Regulation: U.S. Law, Federal Reserve Bank Regulations
* Payment Network Economy: ATM withdrawals incur network fees

In many ways, cash is the simplest payment system in the United States. As a self-clearing "push" payment system, it lacks the complexity of open-loop or closed-loop systems. It is a non-account-based system: both payees and payers can use it without establishing any type of account or service relationship with the provider. It is a virtual payment system that no one owns, and no one writes "rules" for cash. Interestingly, it is the only payment method that both payers and payees can use anonymously. Perhaps due to this simplicity, it is both the most commonly used payment method and often the most difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore how cash enters the economy, the content involved in cash use and circulation, and who benefits from the system.

## Cash Magnitude

No one really knows the true volume of cash transactions in the U.S. economy. (Recently, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco) has estimated the number of cash payments made by U.S. consumers. But there is evidently no way to systematically account for transactions between individuals. This is also true for many payments made by small businesses or sole proprietorships, as well as cash wages paid to temporary or "off-the-books" employees. Of course, cash is heavily used in the criminal economy. Finally, some economists estimate that as much as 60% of the cash produced in the U.S. is actually held overseas.

### Vast Amounts of Cash

Jason Goodwin in his book "Greenback" points out, "There are more U.S. banknotes in existence than any other branded item, including Coca-Cola cans."
