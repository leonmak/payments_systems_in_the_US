# Payment Innovation

_"My general analysis of my PayPal experience is that if I knew all the information about the payment field that I know now, I would never have started this company."_

## Introduction

At Glenbrook, we are excited about payment innovation. Rooted in Silicon Valley, we have a unique advantage to interact face-to-face with entrepreneurs who are paving the way to change the world and the venture capitalists funding them.

We closely monitor news related to payments, commerce, and relevant technologies every day. We share interesting findings on our daily news blog at PaymentsNews.com and often highlight news that we suspect may impact our clients' businesses in the future.

As a result, we evaluate many new payment concepts and companies, often to serve our clients and sometimes just to educate ourselves. We also forecast the market and make predictions about the likelihood of specific innovations succeeding. Sometimes we are right, sometimes we are wrong, but we believe we are often right!

However, whenever we miss out on a new market or idea, we remain humble and must play catch-up with others! (An example: the emergence of a third-party distribution model in prepaid cards, leading to the success of companies like Blackhawk Network and InComm.) We are constantly striving to understand new innovative payment methods that we have not yet seen or anticipated, whether it be changes based on technology, business models, regulatory environment, marketing, and more.

When we started offering a two-day "deep dive" beginner's training camp on the U.S. payment industry in the summer of 2005, we primarily focused on the foundational knowledge of the five core payment systems in the U.S., how users use them for payments, and how providers and infrastructure keep everything running smoothly. We spent little time describing how these systems evolved.

However, we quickly realized that while focusing on the basics was useful for our participants, many of them were also very interested in our perspective on how these systems were evolving based on the rapid pace of technological innovation already underway. We have significantly improved the Payments Boot Camp over the initial few years, addressing these issues. Now, we spend almost every second day on emerging payment technologies and payment innovation. And as the industry evolves, we continuously update the content to keep up with the industry's changes. So far, we have trained over 14,000 payment professionals in public and private payment boot camps and workshops.

Due to this ever-changing pace, we briefly introduced emerging payments and innovations in the first two editions of this book. In this edition, we attempt a more comprehensive study of the topic, describing some important lessons learned from payment innovation over the past decade.

Lastly, we also examine some of the most significant technological and cultural changes that may lead to future innovations. We hope this broader approach will provide a more suitable basis for our research on the U.S. payment system, and we welcome your comments and feedback!
